I want to start by saying this has been a huge learning experience and 
I put a lot of small details to enhance the game experience and I hope you enjoy it!

I made a 4 player split screen where you compete against 3 computer controlled enemies.
Screen watching is part of the strategy where you can peak at another's viewport. 
It's similar to playing GoldenEye on the Nintendo 64! 

Start menu:     Move the cursor, choose a difficulty, and select multiplayer.
Character menu: Pick each character or press Start to skip.
The Game:       You are the bottom left corner. First character to get 3 kills wins!

The enemies will randomly look around.
If you can see an enemy, they will slowly turn towards you and lock on and fire.
If you fire at them when they can't see you, they will turn towards you and fire.
If they can see you even if you aren't looking at them, they will lock on and fire.
When anyone dies, they will spawn in a new random unoccupied location.
